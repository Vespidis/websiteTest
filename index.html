<h1>My IT Profile</h1>
<h4> What are your interests and plans for you future in IT, and why did you choose RMIT? </h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>From a personal perspective I’ve always had an interest in IT. being part of a generation where interacting with technology was integral, it’s just a part of my everyday life. On a personal level I spend most of my spare time playing video games. Professionally though, IT is something entirely different. I absolutely love problem solving, thinking outside the box, or remaking old processes into something new and more efficient. So professionally I’m attracted to the idea of programming, what that specifically means in 3 years time, I’m not sure.  Perhaps I’ll look at software development or security, but right now that means I’m passionate about learning new languages!</li>
<li>I chose to come to RMIT because they offered what I needed through OUA. A flexible course that I could do at a reasonable pace whilst working full time. It’s very hard to put the brakes on and go back to studying, but this means I get the best of both worlds through a little hard work.</li>
<li>I expect to learn more in depth about the many and varied paths that I can take in IT. In addition to this, I hope to learn more about hardware and how hardware and software interact. I expect to learn more about programming languages as well.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

These tests all indicate that I have a tendency to be a creative and anayltical thinker, but that I sometimes miss the details for the bigger picture, so what I should be looking for when it comes to groups/teamwork are people who are detail orientedwho can look at the finer details and balance me out in that regard. I think these results point towards my goals aligning with my internal strengths, as I think being creative and having a bigger picture idea of problems are what make a good programmer but that I should be careful to not lose focus without getting anything done.In addition to this, I should always try to put together a visual que or have someone talk me through an idea if I don't understand it, as this is how I learn best.

<h1>My Project</h1>

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>The intention of the project (GlobeTouch) is to provider customers of the Cruising (and travel) industry, an interactive booking resource that provides a more dynamic experience.
This user interface will allow guests to have a more kinaesthetic experience when booking their holidays, by allowing them to “interact” with a world globe, which will then give them all the required information whilst booking their holiday.
</p>

<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>Of the world’s leading cruise lines, including business’ such as Carnival Cruise Line, Holland America, Norwegian Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean, the vast majority of them offer an extremely basic an objectively boring booking experience, a simple search engine which provides a return list of available cruises which can often be hard to grasp for many potential customers (See example links for common cruise searches). In addition to this, varying studies have shown that in general, a more interactive online experience will increase user satisfaction. <br><br>

Whilst these list styles will appeal to some visual learners, what it fails to do is capture the “experience” factor and enhance the excitement of travelling to a destination that’s often half the world away. What I hope to do with TouchGlobe (my current name for the project) is provide a booking experience that appeals to not just visual learners, but also kinaesthetic and auditory learners too. Whilst maintaining an efficient and streamlined qualifying/booking experience to maximise revenue.

</p>

<b>Sample Cruise Searches</b><br><ul>

<li><a href="https://www.ncl.com/au/en/vacations?ships=Norwegian_Jewel">Norwegian Cruise Line</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gadventures.com/destinations/asia/indonesia/#">G Adventures</a></li>

</ul>



<h4>Project Description</h4>
<p>GlobeTouch is an interactive world globe, allowing users to control their destination/holiday planning, by putting them through an interactive qualifying process. Essentially balancing the need for user experience, and valuable data gathering for the parent company.<br><br>

Initially the guest will interact with a world globe, but before they can look at specific cruises they will be asked the following;
<ul>
<li><b>Where would you like to travel?:</b><br> This will initiate the GlobeTouch globe, and will spin the globe display to their selected region (ie, europe, spain, chile, mexico) if the guest selects an unavailable destionation, GlobeTouch will reference it's library for nearest ports of origin and suggest that instead</li>
<li><b>When would you like to travel?: MM/YYYY</b> <br> This will whittle down available options for cruising, so the guest is not overwhelmed, and will prompt GlobeTouch's next phase the planning phase</li>
</ul>
The planning phase is the "interactive" aspect to the GlobeTouch booking engine, where the GlobeTouch globe will then "intialise" for the guest, and show their selected region, with ports of origin(cruise start) highlighted by green ship icons, and all other ports of call (accessible from one of the parent companies cruises) highlighted in yellow. 
The guest can click on any highlighted ports for the following information; 
<ul>
  <li><b>Available Cruises</b><br>Available Cruises will show all cruises available for the month and year, that originate or travel through the port selected. If the guest selects a port, GlobeTouch will map their cruise(including direction of travel for best cabin selection) to the globe, and highlight the start/finish port in blue. If the guest chooses to book the cruise at this point, there is a "Book Holiday" button at the top, which will take them through the rest of the booking process.
  </li>
  <li><b>Port Overview</b><br> If the guest selects port information, a summary page is brought up, in-window, which provides a simple description of the port, weather at the time they have selected, port access information (ie transfers etc) and port address/websites</li>
  <li><b>Sightseeing / Shore Excursions</b><br> If the guest selects sightseeing/shore excursions they are taken to a zoomed in map of the port, which has title summaries of the excursion available over their location (ie collosseum). If the information is too crowded, a list view can be brought, which again pops up in-window.</li>
</ul> 
</p>


<h4>Tools/Technologies/Skills Required</h4>
<p> This is a fairly straightforward project, the complicated part is creating the intearctive globe UI
  <ul>
  <li>HTML - Website Design</li>
  <li>Javascript - GlobeTouch design / API for Cruise Website</li>
  <li>UI Design</li>

</ul></p>


<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p>If the project is implemented correctly, the ideal outcome is to increase revenue for the business, whilst helping to clarify and de-clutter the booking for the guest, thus benefitting both business and their clientele. Due to the simplicity of this project, the return on investment potential is quite high.</p>
