                        <p><br>I have always had a personal interest in IT mostly from the perspective of video games, I spent my childhood playing video games like the Legend of Zelda and Banjo Kazooie, and other awesome Nintendo games, and I became fascinated
                            with the IT world. However, I never really considered a career in it because I was so focused on becoming an engineer, but I eventually realised that my passion for problem solving could be used and applied in programming and
                            development, and so I taught myself some python, and eventually decided to pursue a career in it because the logic of programming seemed to fit with how I thought and processed the world. I have little to no professional experience
                            in the IT world, but I’m excited to see where this degree takes me.<br><br></p>

                        <p><br>My interest in IT goes back to the 80’s when my friends had Amiga 500 and Commodore 64. My first computer was a 80286 pc, before getting 80386Dx 40 and followed by 80486 DX50 in the 90’s. I started in Dos 3.3 and Windows 3.0
                            and did all my stuff on the pc by then. Assignments and games were all done on a computer ever since. Later in the late 90’s I worked in the IT field of assemble, diagnose and troubleshoot PC’s, servers, printers and operating
                            system in Windows 98 / Se and Windows NT / 2000. By the time Windows XP rolled around, I started to move into Telecommunications industry in Telstra as sub-contract for 3G SDH network growth. The work requires travel around
                            the country, and in my case majority of the east coast of Australia where the population is more dense. I have always kept up to date with IT in terms of hardware and software and I am also a PC Gamer, and have a large collection
                            of games in steam (though I have only played a fraction of those games).<br><br></p>

                        <p><br>I’ve been living and breathing IT since I was a young child and we had our first computer, a Commodore 64. I always wanted to work out how they worked, and I was always the one that caught the blame when something went wrong
                            because I was always tinkering, fiddling, and working things out. When finished yr12 I went into a course doing Computer forensics, which gave me enough knowledge and experience to jump into an IT support role after I dropped
                            out of the course. Since that first job in IT, I’ve worked a lot of positions both in and out of IT, I’ve studied an Advanced Diploma in Video Game Art and Animation, and generally gained a great appreciation for the diversity
                            and hard work that goes into even the seemingly simple games I play. Looking to the future I plan to focus on software engineering and programming to finally make my own way in the IT industry.<br><br></p>

                            for almost 8 years. I am a father of 3 children, who keep me very busy. When I am not spending time with my children, I love to go Mountain Biking. As I live in Canberra, I am very spoilt for places to go riding. As I have
                            worked in the IT industry for over 12 years, I realise there are so many opportunites. I am excited to see where this degree takes me<em>.</em><br><br></p>
